            <h2>c420 sailboat</h2>
            <p><h3>The c420 sailboat is a sailboat designed mainly for racing it consists of up to three sails,
            	the<strong> main sail</strong>, the<strong> jib</strong> and when racing the <strong>spinnaker</strong>
            	the main sail is the big sail in the center, the main sail is controled by the main sheets which tighten and losen the sails. 
            	the horesontel beam that goes across and is connected to the mast is called the boom this holds up the sail as it goes further out.
            The jib is a smaller sail the is an essenstal part of going fast and turning, if you dont turn the jib on the right side then you can not succsesfully tac or gyve. The spinnaker is a sail that luffs in the wind and acts sort of like a parachute it can only be used in down wind because it catches the air, when you are going up wind you take down the spinnaker and tighten the sails. One reason why the sailboat is good is becasue it all comes from nature. Another pro is it is more affordable.</h3></p>

            	<h2>motor boats</h2>
            	<p><h3>In my opion motor boats are more reliable then sailboats because you can always move even without wind but, this comes with a cost,
            		you have to by for gas and use up non-renuable resorces. Another pro is that motor boats alow you to drag things easiely such as doing tubing on the back where you tow a person on a float. Another good thing is that you are legaly alowed to drive a motor boat at 14 with a superviser. One downside is your jurnies are limited in a motor boat due to gas.</h3></p>
